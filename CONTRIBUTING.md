## ðŸ“‚ File Naming and Versioning

### Adding a Solution to a New Exercise

Use the following format to name solution files:

```
exercise_<chapter_number>_<exercise_number>_v1_0_0.html
exercise_<chapter_number>_<exercise_number>_v1_0_0.js
```

**Examples:**

- HTML: `exercise_2_11_v1_0_0.html`
- JS: `exercise_3_05_v1_0_0.js`

Use the correct extension for the language used (`.html`, `.js`, or `.css` if needed).

### Updating an Existing Solution

Use [Semantic Versioning (SemVer)](https://semver.org/) for updates:

```
v<MAJOR>.<MINOR>.<PATCH>
```

#### Versioning Rules

- **MAJOR** â€“ Breaking or incompatible changes.
- **MINOR** â€“ Backward-compatible additions or improvements.
- **PATCH** â€“ Bug fixes or small adjustments (e.g., improved formatting or accessibility tweaks).

**Examples:**

- Fixing a bug in form validation:
  ```
  exercise_2_11_v1_0_1.js
  ```
- Adding responsive styles:
  ```
  exercise_2_11_v1_1_0.html
  ```

Keep all versions of a file to maintain a visible evolution of solutions.

## ðŸ“œ Code Documentation

Each file must begin with a metadata comment block. For `.html` and `.js`, use the appropriate format.
